Using ChatGPT as a reference, I am making a drawing app based on terminal using java

Day 1: idea

a few weeks ago, I started making a storyboard on paper of one of my animations and in the animation it ends with an error screen, so instead of faking one, I decided to make a real one, but a the moment it is just a paper sketch

day 2: window

the implementation of the screen in java was not that much difficult because I already have used the jframe method before and it works like a charm.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the Canvas extension, while applying the rendering method using Canvas and BufferedStategy as I already used before,
the method refused to work even with no red lines and indications of what is wrong. the error only appeard during the compilation and debug, so even after rewatching 
the tutorial and appling the code, it did not work as well, so I asked chatgpt for a fix and it used a different way of rendering using jpanel and paintcompoent which is basically a container
